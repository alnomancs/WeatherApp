## Code Overview

### HTML

The HTML file (`index.html`) contains the structure of the application, including the input field, the "Add" button, and the task list.

### CSS

The CSS file (`styles.css`) provides the styling for the application, ensuring it looks clean and user-friendly.

### JavaScript

The JavaScript file (`script.js`) contains the functionality for adding, removing, and marking tasks as completed. It also handles saving and loading tasks from local storage.

### Local Storage

Tasks are saved in local storage in the form of an array of objects, each containing the task text and its completion status. This ensures tasks persist across browser sessions.
